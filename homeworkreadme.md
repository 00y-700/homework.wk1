# Homework Week 1: Code Refactor

I reviewed the index.html file and changed the generalized &lt;div&gt; tags to more specific semantic HTML tags.
Many of these &lt;div&gt; tags contained classes that were no longer necessary once the element had a specific semantic tag so I removed those classes that were no longer necessary and updated the css stylesheet to reflect these changes.
These tag changes involved changing &lt;div&gt; tags to some of the following: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;

The first link in the navigation bar for Search Engine Optimization was broken. After investigating I discovered that it was lacking the necessary ID to connect the link to its appropriate section. I added the ID "search-engine-optimization" to the list item and this corrected that problem.

In the heading I made sure to have the instructions and links in the appropriate order. I changed the title from "Website" to "Horiseon"
