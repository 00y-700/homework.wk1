# Homework Week 1: Code Refactor

I reviewed the index.html file and changed the generalized <div> tags to more specific semantic HTML tags.
Many of these <div> tags contained classes that were no longer necessary once the element had a specific semantic tag so I removed those classes that were no longer necessary and updated the css stylesheet to reflect these changes.
These tag changes involved changing div tags to some of the following: <header>, <nav>, <figure>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, <article>, and <footer>

The first link in the navigation bar for Search Engine Optimization was broken. After investigating I discovered that it was lacking the necessary ID to connect the link to its appropriate section. I added the ID "search-engine-optimization" to the list item and this corrected that problem.
